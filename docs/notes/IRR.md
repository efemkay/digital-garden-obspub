## Additional note on IRR
- #### Specific characteristics of IRR.
	- It **accounts** for the time value of money
	- It considers cash flows over the economic life of the investment
		- an IRR higher than the minimum desired rate of return provides an incremental economic gain beyond satisfying a normal earnings standard
	- It does not give any indication about the size of the initial investment.
		- Under a constrained budget situation, it is desirable to invest in a lower-yielding, larger-size project rather than a higher-yielding, smaller-size project
	- It does not give direct indication of the value of the investment.
	- The IRRs are not additive.
		- The only valid procedure is to combine the cash flows of the projects under consideration and then determine the IRR for the combined cash flow
	- IRR is not affected by delays in project start dates.
		- If a project starts several years in the future, then the net present value of the project is reduced because its annual net cash flows must be discounted more
	- Risk (probability) cannot be mathematically incorporated in the IRR equation.
	- IRR can be computed for after-tax and before-tax cash flows
- #### Situations when IRR cannot be calculated
	- [[IRR has 3 key pitfalls to watch out for|IRR has 3 key pitfalls to watch out for]]
	- additionally, IRR cannot be calculated when cash flows are either all negative or all positive
		- or the opposite cash flow is too insignificant
